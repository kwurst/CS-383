Each range includes the lower value, but not the upper value. For example, the range of 80 to 83 includes all grades up to, but not including 83. The highest range does, however, include 100%.

## Attendance and Participation

You must attend all class meetings. Your attendance and participation in class will be scored as follows:

Score | Description
---|---
2 | Present and Participating
1 | Late or missing a significant portion of class
0 | Absent or not participating
<img src=exempt.png> | Excused Absence*

*An excused absence is determined by the instructor. Ideally, it will be arranged in advance. Otherwise, the instructor must be notified of the absence and the reason as soon as possible, preferrably by the end of the day. The excused absence will not count for or against your Attendance and Participation grade - instead the Attendance and Participation grade will be calculated out of one fewer class meetings.

## Projects and Homework
You will have a number of homework assignments and team projects to practice what you learn in the readings.

## Exams

There will be two exams.

## Final Group Project and Presentation

After Spring Break we will work on individual or group projects. These projects can be more advanced work with some of the tools and technologies we worked with in class, or the investigation and application of new tools or technologies.

During the scheduled final exam period, you will present your final project to the class. Our Final Exam period is scheduled for Monday, 8 May 2015 - 12:30pm-3:30pm.

## Deliverables
All work will be submitted electronically through a variety of tools. The due date and time will be given on the assignment. The submission date and time will be determined by the submission timestamp of the tool used.

**Please do not submit assignments to me via email.** It is difficult for me to keep track of them and I often fail to remember that they are in my mailbox when it comes time to grade the assignment.

## Late Submissions
Late assignments will lose 10% of the maximum points per 24-hour period.

## Getting Help
If you are struggling with the material or a project please see me as soon as possible. Often a few minutes of individual attention is all that is needed to get you back on track.

By all means, try to work out the material on your own, but ask for help when you cannot do that in a reasonable amount of time. The longer you wait to ask for help, the harder it will be to catch up. 

I am here to help you understand the material and be successful in the course.

## Worcester State Library
Worcester State Library has access to many articles through online databases including J-STOR. In addition many articles and book chapters are available to students through Inter-Library Loan (ILL).  With a little planning, ILL expands your ability to get credible information sources about topics you pursue in your course work.  Finally WSU students are free to use many of the library resources within the consortium. Given all of these resources it is extremely unlikely that you should have to pay for access to individual articles. Please work with the reference librarians to find the appropriate way to access materials you need.  You have already paid for these resources through your fees—please make use of them.

## Academic Conduct
Each student is responsible for the contents of the readings, discussions, class materials, textbook and handouts. 

**You should familiarize yourself with Worcester State College's Academic Honesty policy. The policy outlines what constitutes academic dishonesty, what sanctions may be imposed and the procedure for appealing a decision. The complete Academic Honesty Policy appears in: <a href="http://www.worcester.edu/CodeofConduct/" target="_blank">http://www.worcester.edu/CodeofConduct/</a>**

**If you have a serious problem that prevents you from finishing an assignment on time, contact me and we'll come up with a solution.**
